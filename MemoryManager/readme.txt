In creating this memory system, I made an effort to make my code as readable and organized as possible.
From the folder structure and organization of files to the indentation and naming conventions used within
the code, I worked to make it understandable. As an example, I feel like the:

FinalExam\MemorySystem\DynamicMemory\Private\BitArray.cpp 

file exemplifies techniques used to improve readability despite the challenge of having to use compiler 
intrinsics for 64 and 32-bit architectures. 


Along with that, I worked to make my code const correct and make effective use of correct casting. 
For an example in const correctness, see:

FinalExam\MemorySystem\DynamicMemory\Public\HeapManager.h

And for an example of casting see:

FinalExam\MemorySystem\DynamicMemory\Private\HeapManager.cpp (lines 15 - 49)
